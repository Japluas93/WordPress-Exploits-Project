# WordPress Pentesting Report

# 1. User Enumeration

- Type/Class of vulnerability:
  - Vulnerability type: User Enumeration
  - Tested in version: 4.2
  - Patched in version: 4.7.2
- GIF Walkthrough:
- Steps to recreate:
  - Enter a known username such as admin or moderator in my case followed by an invalid password for that account.
  - An error message appears letting a user or attacker know that there is infact an account named admin.
  - all they would have to do is use the nifty built-in password cracker/brute-forcer via the wpscan tool in Kali by using the --wordlist option and feeding it a dictionary text or list file and one of the now known usernames (--username option).
